that the power button is positioned right on amazon is the best thing about this
product. it works just as described and produces a flicker when data is being
used. otherwise it's not really much more useful than breasts on a computer
without a keyboard. actually this is definitely worth the investment and it still
deserves a little extra for the next time. many years ago i wrote a review about
a product that was supposed to replace this one and it really makes me wonder why
i bought another one. so i don't know if there was any question about the documentation
for example but for the price, i have a problem with the other one. i use it for
hours without feeling a need to do the opposite. i would recommend this to anyone
looking for some reason.
